## Workflow
This project uses a trunk-based with short-lived feature branches, and rebase as a git strategy. Feature branches must be self-contained and tied to an issue ticket, and are squashed before rebased onto main after approved PR.

Commits are made following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention: 
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```
Where `<type>` is one from the table below. 
An optional `scope` can be added for further context, e.g `fix(server): misspelled application config key`.


| Type     | Description                                                              |

| style    | Changes that do not affect meaning of code, formatting, white-space etc. |
| refactor | Changes that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.                     |

| ci       | Changes to CI configuration files and scripts.                           |
